### Provide a Docker image

The source of your Docker image, which can come from a private repository that the credentials are provided. For [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/) images, use the following URL format:

```

<namespace>/<image_name>:<tag>

```

If you are pulling a public image from Docker Hub, use the following format:

```

<namespace>/<image_name>:<tag>

```

quay.io/<namespace>/<image_name>:<tag>

```
