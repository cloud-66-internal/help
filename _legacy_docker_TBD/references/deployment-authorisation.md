## About Deployment authorization

For docker stacks where you want additional control over deployment authorizations, you can now go to the stack settings page an choose a deployment lockdown strategy. There are currently three deployment strategies available:

 -  **No Deployment Lockdown:**
   This is the default behaviour and means that deployments will go through without any additional approval.
 - **Anyone on your team:**
   This setting implies that deployments will only happen if *at least* two members on your project with deploy permissions agree to deploy your stack. This is commonly known as four-eyes authorization.
 - **Specific team members:**
   This setting implies that only a specific user (or users in this group) will have permissions to approve depoyment requests.

If a deployment lockdown strategy is in place, then the "Deploy" button will be replaced with a "Request Deploy" button. Users with approval rights can then go to the stack's Deployment Timeline on the "Build & Deployment right navigation option". There they can approve or deny deployment requests. Note that the person who raised the request can also cancel that request here.

Once a deployment request is approved, the deployment will take place. The audit log and deployment history pages will list who raised the deployment request and who approved it.



### IMPORTANT
 At this time, this setting applies to Docker stacks only.
 



## Cloud Lockdown

For larger organisations with multiple cloud keys and multiple departments requiring access to different cloud keys, we now allow deployment "targets" to be locked down at a user permission level for all users in your team. 

From the Account -> Teams menu, you can edit permissions for any user; specifically now you can "Restrict deployment targets" to a list of deployment targets (including "Registered Servers")
