#### Note
<div class="notice"><p>
You always have a <kbd>default</kbd> profile which cannot be deleted or renamed. </p></div>

#### Switching between profiles

To switch between profiles, use `cx config use NAME`

All commands from that point onwards will run against the `NAME` profile. This is persisted between different terminal sessions until it's changed.

#### Setting Profile per command

If you would like to run a command with a different profile other than the current profile, you can use the `--profile` argument with all commands:

    cx --profile NAME stacks list

#### Using profiles with organizations

When you create a profile you can specify the organization to which this new profile should be linked. For example:

    cx config create hobby --org my_private_sandbox

...will create a profile named "hobby" that is linked to a Cloud 66 organization named "my_private_sandbox".

If you're unsure about the name of an organization you can run the `cx info` command and looking at the `Name` field. You can also see this by logging into your Dashboard, visiting Account Settings and clicking on Organisations in the Account panel on the left.
