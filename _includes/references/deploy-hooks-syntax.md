## What are deploy hooks?

Deploy hooks are scripts that allow you to automate actions at various points during the deployment process for your applications. If youâ€™ve never used hooks before, we have [a tutorial](/rails/tutorials/deploy-hooks.html) that walks you through the basics. You can also use our examples at the bottom of this page.

## Hook points

The deployment process is divided into a number of steps, and hook points allow you to intervene at various points during this process.

## Hook fields

There are four types of deploy hooks, and the fields available (and required) vary by type:

1.  **Snippets:** use pre-existing scripts to install common packages. These snippets are [open source](https://github.com/cloud66/snippets), and are created by Cloud 66 or third parties.
2. **Commands:** run your own commands.
3. **Existing Scripts:** use your own existing scripts for more comprehensive procedures (Rails/Node applications only)
4. **Inline Scripts:** use your own inline scripts for more comprehensive procedures
