## What are deploy hooks?

Deploy hooks are scripts that allow you to automate actions at various points during the deployment process for your applications. If youâ€™ve never used hooks before, we have [a tutorial](/{{page.collection}}/tutorials/deploy-hooks.html) that walks you through the basics. You can also use our examples at the bottom of this page.

## Hook points

The deployment process is divided into a number of steps, and hook points allow you to intervene at various points during this process.

The table below is arranged in the order in which each hook point occurs in the deployment process (from earliest to latest):

## Hook fields

There are different types of deploy hooks, and the fields available (and required) vary by type:

1.  **Snippets:** use "off the shelf" scripts to install common packages. These snippets are [open source](https://github.com/cloud66/snippets), and are created by Cloud 66 or other third parties.
2. **Commands:** run your own commands.
3. **Inline Scripts:** use your own inline scripts for more comprehensive procedures
{% if include.product == 'rails' or include.product == 'node' %}4. **Existing Scripts:** use your own existing scripts for more comprehensive procedures (Rails/Node applications only){% endif %}
