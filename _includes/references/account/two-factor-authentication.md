## What is two-factor authentication?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires a second set of credentials, in addition to a password and username, before it will allow access to an account. You can read more about the concept in [our Security Score guide](/{{page.collection}}/account/understanding-and-improving-security-score.html#why-do-i-need-2fa). 

## Enabling 2FA on your account

To enable two-factor authentication on your Cloud 66 account: 

1. Open your [Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your account avatar (top-right) and select *Account Settings*
3. Click on *Login & Security* in the **Account** panel on the left
4. Click on the *Two-factor Authentication* tab
5. Install the Google Authenticator app on your phone (links are provided) and then click the green *Next - verify your phone*  button
6. Scan the barcode provided using your newly installed Authenticator app (you can also manually enter the details of the key if you're having trouble scanning the barcode)
7. Enter the verification code provided by Authenticator and click the *Verify* button

## Logging in with 2FA

If 2FA is enabled, when you log in you will be asked to provide the current confirmation code from the Google Authenticator app. This code changes constantly (every minute or so), so it will be different every time you log in.

## Enforcing 2FA for your team

You can also force all the members of your Cloud 66 account to use 2FA. To do this:

1. Open your [Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your account avatar (top-right) and select *Account Settings*
3. Click on *Login & Security* in the **Account** panel on the left
4. Scroll down to the section named "Enforce 2FA for your Team" and click the green *Force 2FA for your_team_name* button.

This will oblige all team members to set up 2FA before they are able to continue using their Cloud 66 account.


## Adding a physical FIDO security key

Physical security keys add another layer of security to your account, making it even harder for anyone to gain unauthorised access. If you need more background info on physical keys please read our [detailed guide] on the subject.

To add a physical key (including a Krypton key):

1. Open your [Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your account avatar (top-right) and select *Account Settings*
3. Click on *Login & Security* in the **Account** panel on the left
4. Click on the *Security Keys* tab
5. Follow the instructions on screen to pair your physical device to your Cloud 66 account

## Troubleshooting

### If you're using a USB-based device:

- Ensure you've read the installation and usage instructions from the manufacturer
- Ensure that your computer recognises and is able to read the device (including that it is properly inserted into a compatible port)
- Work through this [troubleshooting guide](https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000008691-basic-yubikey-troubleshooting) from Yubikey (many of these issues are common to other USB devices)

### If you're using the Krypton app:

- Be sure you have installed the Krypton browser extension on your preferred browser. This is the mechanism Krypton uses to authenticate the presence of your device - it will not work without the extension installed. You can find instructions on how to do this by touching the *Help* button at the top right corner of the mobile app.
- Once you have installed the extension on your browser you will need to pair that browser with the Krypton app. To do this:
    - Click on the Krypton browser extension icon to open the pairing panel
    - Touch the "scan" button at the bottom of the app
    - Scan the QR code displayed by in the pairing panel
- After you have paired your browser to Krypton, follow the instructions above to add a Krypton key to Cloud 66. It's best to have the Krypton app open when you start the process as this speeds things up.

## Add a recovery phone number

We strongly suggest that you add your phone number on the *Account* page to recover your account should you at some point not be able to access your verification codes on your phone.
