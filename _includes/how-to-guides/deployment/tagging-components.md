## Overview

Many of the infrastructural and configuration components managed by Cloud 66 can be tagged. This includes entire applications, individual servers within an application, and many other elements like services and templates. These tags are useful for searching and filtering application components, both manually and as part of automated processes. 

## Adding tags to a server

To **add** a tag to a server:

1. Log into your Cloud 66 dashboard and click on your application
2. Click on the Servers tab in the main panel
3. Click on the name of the server you'd like to tag
4. Click on the tag icon (üè∑) at the top right of the Server info panel and then click on *Add Tags*
5. Type in your tag and click *Save*
6. You should now be able to see the tag just below your server's name.
