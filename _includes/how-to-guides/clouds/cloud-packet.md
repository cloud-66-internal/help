You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Packet](https://www.packet.net/).

## Adding your Packet credentials

Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select Get started building an application. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select Packet and provide your Packet API Key from _API Keys_ on your _Packet Dashboard_. 

#### Note
