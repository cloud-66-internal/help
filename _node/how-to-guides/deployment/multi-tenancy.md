<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>If you're planning to host multiple applications on a single server, please consider moving your application to <a href="https://www.cloud66.com/containers/maestro/">Cloud 66 Maestro</a> which is designed with exactly that kind of use case in mind. We offer a 4 week free trial of Maestro so you can try it with no risk. Node for Cloud 66 <strong>does not support multi-tenancy</strong> - it is intended for hosting traditional, standalone Node apps.
