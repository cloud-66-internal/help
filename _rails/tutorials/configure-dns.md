## Cloud 66 hostnames

Cloud 66 creates unique [DNS hostnames](/rails/references/server-ip-addresses.html#cloud-66-hostnames) for each server you deploy with us. These use animal names to make them more easily recognizable. For example:

```shell
puma.railsdemo.development.c66.me
walrus.myapp.production.c66.me
```

This allows you to change the servers (and therefore IP addresses) for your application without needing to change any public DNS entries.

### Failover hostnames

In addition to unique hostnames per server, Cloud 66 also offers [Failover Groups](/rails/tutorials/failover-groups.html) - managed, quick-response DNS addresses that automatically follow the web endpoints of applications.

Each Failover Group has a unique hostname with a 9 digit prefix (subdomain). For example `958-797-516.cloud66.net`. For maximum reliability, you should point your DNS at a Failover Group address.

## Best practices for DNS

You will need to update the DNS records for your domain to point at Cloud 66. Where possible, you should avoid using a DNS A-record (which points directly at an IP address). Instead, you should use `CNAME` records to point your domain at a Cloud 66 hostname (either your server or failover group hostname). 

However, this may not be possible with your DNS provider. While CNAME records do not require hard-coded IP addresses, they are often not available to root domains (e.g. `example.com`). In other words, you may not be able to set a CNAME record pointing example.com to a Cloud 66 hostname. See **option 2** below for a solution to this issue.

To use wildcard subdomains with Cloud 66 hostnames, simply create a CNAME record pointing `*. .com` to your Cloud 66 hostname. 


## Configuring your DNS

There are three approaches to configuring your DNS - in the following recommended order:

### 1. Use an Alias or Aname

Some DNS hosts provide a CNAME-like functionality at the zone apex (root domain) using a custom record type.

For example:

- [ALIAS at DNSimple](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/alias-record)
- [ANAME at DNS Made Easy](http://help.dnsmadeeasy.com/managed-dns/records/aname-records/)
- [ANAME at easyDNS](https://fusion.easydns.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/190/0/aname-records)
- [ALIAS at AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingAliasRRSets.html)

The setup is similar for each provider - simply point the ALIAS or ANAME for your root domain to the [Cloud 66 hostname](#cloud-66-hostnames) for your application.


### 2. Use an A record with a load balancer

This involves using an `A` record to point your root domain at your load balancer and then redirecting traffic to www in Nginx.

1.  Create a CNAME record for `www` pointing at the [Cloud 66 hostname](#cloud-66-hostnames) of your load balancer.
2.  Create an `A` record for your root domain (e.g. `example.com`) pointing at your load balancer IP address.
3.  ​Use [network redirects](/rails/tutorials/service-network-configuration.html) to permanently redirect all traffic from `example.com` to `www.example.com`.

### 3. Subdomain redirection


#### Important
<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>
This method will not work if you are serving content with SSL, and only works for HTTP traffic (i.e. not TCP or UDP). </p></div>

This method creates a 301 permanent redirect to a specified subdomain for all root domain traffic.

1. Create a DNS forward of `example.com` to `www.example.com`.
2. Create a CNAME record with value `www` to the [Cloud 66 hostname](#cloud-66-hostnames).
