## What is a backup verifier?

A backup verifier is a great way to ensure that your backups actually contain the data you expect. You simply provide a query that you expect to return a specific result, and we verify that your backup returns this value. 

This feature supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and requires the use of managed backups. Backup verification runs once every 6 hours for each application, and you will be notified in the case of a failured verification.

## Set up a backup verifier

1. Create a file in the .cloud66 folder in the root of your repository. To verify your backups across all environments, name the file: 
 * `backup_verifier_mysql.sql` for MySQL
 * `backup_verifier_pg.sql` for PostgreSQL
2. You can also specify which environment to run backup verifiers for by appending the environment to the filename. For example, `backup_verifier_mysql_production.sql` or `backup_verifier_pg_staging.sql`.

#### Important
<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>
By including this script in your repository, you are opting in to the use of verified backups and will be charged accordingly. Please see our <a href="https://www.cloud66.com/rails/pricing">pricing page</a> for more info. </p></div>

To verify your backup, the script must contain a SQL query that returns a data set containing a single column called "Result" with a value of `true` or `false`. We have examples for each type of database below.

Your backup will be assumed to be verified if the value returned from the query is `true`.

Should you need to change your verification script at some point, simply commit the change to Git and redeploy your code.

### Example query: MySQL

This query will count the number of records in the users table, and returns a 1 if that number is not zero.

```
select count(*)<>0 as result from users
```

That query may return the following output (non-zero values are interpreted as true in MySQL), indicating that your users table holds data.

```
result
1
```

### Example query: PostgreSQL

This query counts the number of records in the users table, and returns a boolean of true if that number is not zero.

```
select count(*)<>0 as result from users
```

The result of this query may be the following, indicating that your users table holds data.

```
result
--------
t
```

## View backup verification status

To see your backup verification status, visit your Application Overview, and click the link to your managed backup page. A successfully verified backup will display a green tick, and a failure during verification will result in a red cross - clicking on the red cross will show the error message.
