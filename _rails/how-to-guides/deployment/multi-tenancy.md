## Overview

Sometimes you need to run multiple applications on the same server. This could be because none of those applications has enough traffic to justify having a dedicated application for itself or it could be because all the apps on the application share many resources. Whatever the reason, you can achieve multi-tenancy for your applications with [Maestro](https://www.cloud66.com/containers/maestro).


## Multiple Services

To host multiple applications on the same server, we need to put each one into its own service. This can be done using the `service.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  first_app:
    git_url: git@github.com:khash/my_first_app.git
    git_branch: master
    ports: ["3000:80:443"]
  second_app:
    git_url: git@github.com:khash/my_second_app.git
    git_branch: master
    ports: ["3000:80:443"]
  third_app:
    git_url: git@github.com:khash/my_second_app.git
    git_branch: master
    ports: ["3000:80:443"]
```

This however has a problem: all applications share the same public ports (80 and 443). This means traffic coming to the application on port 80 (or 443) will be randomly served by any of the applications each time.

To fix this issue we can use the Domain Matching feature. Domain Matching allows us to share ports and split the traffic by the URL domain name that the client has requested:

```yaml
services:
  first_app:
    git_url: git@github.com:khash/my_first_app.git
    git_branch: master
    ports: ["3000:80:443"]
    traffic_matches: ["firstpplication.com"]
  second_app:
    git_url: git@github.com:khash/my_second_app.git
    git_branch: master
    ports: ["3000:80:443"]
    traffic_matches: ["secondapp.com", "www.secondapp.com", "second-app.com", "www.second-app.com"]
  third_app:
    git_url: git@github.com:khash/my_second_app.git
    git_branch: master
    ports: ["3000:80:443"]
    traffic_matches: ["thirdapplication.com", "*.thirdapplication.com"]
```

In this example, we split the traffic based on the requested domain. As you can see you can match traffic based on multiple domains as well as wildcard (`*`) subdomains.
