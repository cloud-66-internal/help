Start by [SSHing to your server](/rails/how-to-guides/common-tools/ssh.html). Then go to your `STACK_PATH` (e.g. `cd $STACK_PATH`) and run the following command:

```shell
$ bundle exec rails c <environment>
```

**Possible values for \<environment\>:**

*   development (default)
*   test
*   production

To run your Rails console as the Nginx user, you can use the following command:

```shell
$ sudo -u nginx bash -c 'source /var/.cloud66_env && bundle exec rails c'
```
