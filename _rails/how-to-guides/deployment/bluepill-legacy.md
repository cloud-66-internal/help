## Commands

When [bluepill](https://github.com/bluepill-rb/bluepill) is installed on your server, you can control your processes manually from your server command-line interface.

A process Bluepill config is saved into a `.pill` file. Bluepill loads pill files for each process it manages. See also [Bluepill gem page](http://rubygems.org/gems/bluepill).

When you add processes through Cloud 66 interface, they will be managed by Cloud 66. For instance if you restart your server, they will be automatically restart aswell.



## Process names convention

Cloud 66 processes beging with "cloud66\_" and user processes with "user\_"



## Build your own pill file

To build your own process with Bluepill, please refer to this [page](https://github.com/bluepill-rb/bluepill).

Don't forget to add a log file in your pill config. For instance:

```
process.stdout = process.stderr = "<STACK_PATH>/log/process.log"
```

```
$ sudo bluepill status
