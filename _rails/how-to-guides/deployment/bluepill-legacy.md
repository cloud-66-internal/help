## Overview

Bluepill *was* Cloud 66's default process manager until June 2020. It has been replaced by [systemd](/rails/how-to-guides/deployment/systemd.html). Some legacy servers (deployed before June 2020) may still be using Bluepill. To check this:

- Open your [Cloud 66 Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/), and click the application in question
- Click âš™*Settings & Information* in the right-hand panel
- Find the **Process Manager** line - it will show you which one your application is using

<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>If your servers are <strong>not</strong> running Bluepill then you are reading the wrong guide. Please visit the <a href="/rails/how-to-guides/deployment/systemd.html">systemd doc</a> instead.
</p></div>

If you'd like to migrate from Bluepill to systemd, please follow [the migration checklist](/rails/how-to-guides/deployment/systemd.html#migrating-from-bluepill-to-systemd).

## Commands

If [bluepill](https://github.com/bluepill-rb/bluepill) is installed on your server, you can control your processes manually from your server command-line interface.

A process Bluepill config is saved into a `.pill` file. Bluepill loads pill files for each process it manages. See also [Bluepill gem page](http://rubygems.org/gems/bluepill).

When you add processes through Cloud 66 interface, they will be managed by Cloud 66. For instance if you restart your server, they will be automatically restart aswell.


## Process naming convention

Cloud 66 processes beging with "cloud66\_" and user processes with "user\_"


## Build your own pill file

To build your own process with Bluepill, please refer to this [page](https://github.com/bluepill-rb/bluepill).

Don't forget to add a log file in your pill config. For instance:

```
process.stdout = process.stderr = "<STACK_PATH>/log/process.log"
```
