## Overview

Template Libraries are an excellent way to systematise and enforce configuration standards for your application. You can add Skycap Validation Policy definitions to any Template Library to ensure that configuration files (Stencils) generated from that library comply with your policies. 

### Note
<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>
This guide assumes you have a working knowledge of both <a href="/skycap/how-to-guides/formations/create_your_own_stencil_template_repos.html">Template Libraries</a> and <a href="/skycap/tutorials/using-validation-policies.html">Skycap Validation Policies</a>. Please read our separate guides for both these topics if you're unsure about them. </p></div>

## Adding policies to a Template Library

Policies are defined in a Template Library via a central `templates.json` file that sits in the root of the repo.

This is an excerpt from a `templates.json` file that illustrates the structure of the `policies` section:

{% highlight json %}
    "policies": [
             {
                "name": "No Port in Services",
                "filename": "no-port-num.cop",
                "description": "Block a port",
                "selector": "kind: Service",
                "tags": [],
                "preferred_sequence": 0
             },
          ],
{% endhighlight %}

The same `templates.json` file is also used to define the Kubernetes templates (Stencils) and any transformations applied to those templates. For more info, please read our guides to these features. 

### Components of the JSON definition

The Policy section of the `templates.json` has the following fields:

- `name` is the name of the Policy as it will appear in the Skycap UI
- `filename` is the name of the Copper policy file in the Template Library
- `description` is a short description of the policy to help you identify it
- `selector` is the Kubernetes selector for the templates to which the policy will apply (e.g. `kind: Service`)
- `tags` is an array of default tags that will be added to policy files generated by this template
- `preferred_sequence` determines the default sequence in which this policy will be run, relative to any other policies in the Formation.

### Directory structure for policies in a Template Library

Template Libraries must be organized as follows:

- The `templates.json` must be placed in the root directory
- The (Copper) policy files for templates must be placed in a directory named `policies`
