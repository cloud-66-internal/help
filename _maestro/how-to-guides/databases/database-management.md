## Deploying databases

We currently support the following databases, with no need for additional configuration after deployment.

* MySQL (or Percona if [configured via Manifest](/{{page.collection}}/how-to-guides/deployment/building-a-manifest-file.html#mysql))
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Elasticsearch
* RabbitMQ
* SQLite (only in development environments)
* GlusterFS
* InfluxDB

When creating a Maestro application, you can add as many databases as you need in your [service configuration](/maestro/how-to-guides/deployment/docker-service-configuration.html#database-configurations) during the application build. 

After you have analyzed your code, ensure that your desired database type is displayed in the _About your app_ section of the analysis results. If you haven't specified a username and password for your database, Cloud 66 will automatically generate these credentials for you. They will be available as environment variables and your application will be configured to use them.

## Deployment types

### No database (external)
This option allows you to deploy your application without a database managed by Cloud 66, and is ideal if it is hosted externally.

Please note that if there is no connectivity to your database, or your database host is not configured correctly, the deployment will fail.

### Local database
This option deploys your chosen database to the same server as your web server - this is intended primarily for development, as running your database locally in production is not advised. In this case, your application database configuration will be amended to target your local database server. If you scale up your web server, these settings will also be amend automatically to reflect your database configuration.

### Dedicated database
This option will automatically create a new server for your database and configure your application accordingly.

## Upgrading your database

Maestro will not do in-place database upgrades, because this process may cause your application to stop working or may not be possible automatically. To upgrade your database through Maestro, we recommend that you create a new application, at which point Maestro will deploy the newer database version.

Once the new application is created, you can migrate data from your old application to your new application.

## Customizing your database

For a full list of customization options and an explanation of the process, refer to our [Customizing database configuration](/maestro/how-to-guides/databases/database-customization.html) guide.
