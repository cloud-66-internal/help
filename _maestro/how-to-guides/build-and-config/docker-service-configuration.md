## Overview

Service configuration allows you to be more explicit about your Maestro services and control settings that are not usually available through the user interface or Cloud 66 Toolbelt.

These settings describe the composition of your services. Here are some common examples of service configurations you can define:

- Defining build and deploy commands
- Specifying a central logging folder
- Setting port definitions for your containers
- Mounting volumes into your containers
- Setting dependencies between your containers

For a full list of available options, see the [table](#service-configuration-options) at the end of this document.

## Specifying service configurations

While you're building your application, custom service configurations can be accessed by clicking on the *Advanced* tab. This gives you direct access to editing the `service.yml` for your application.

Once your application has been built, you can access `service.yml` under *Configuration Files* in the right menu of your Application Overview.

## Service configuration examples

We have taken these examples from our public Samples repository that you can [access here](https://github.com/cloud66-samples). They are not intended for use as anything except examples.

### Single service with MySQL database

In this example, we'll be configuring a service called *web*, which is pulled from a Git repository and requires a MySQL database.

```yaml
services:
 web:
  log_folder: "/usr/src/app/log"
  ports:
   - container: 3000
      http: 80
      https: 443
   git_url: https://github.com/cloud66-samples/pilot
   git_branch: master
   dockerfile_path: Dockerfile
databases:
- mysql
```

As you can see above, the *web* service is pulled from a sample project on GitHub called Pilot. It specifies both a path for the Dockerfile and a logging folder. Finally, the container is set to listen on port 3000 and uses external ports 80 and 443.

### Multiple services and databases

In this example, we'll be running three services - one called *seller*, one called *buyer* and one called *dashboard* as well as a Redis database. You can define as many services as you need. 

```yaml
services:
 seller:
  git_url: https://github.com/cloud66-samples/acme.git
  git_branch: master
  dockerfile_path: "./Dockerfile"
  build_root: seller
  command: seller --redis redis:6379
 buyer:
  git_url: https://github.com/cloud66-samples/acme.git
  git_branch: master
  dockerfile_path: "./Dockerfile"
  build_root: buyer
  command: buyer --redis redis:6379
 dashboard:
  git_url: https://github.com/cloud66-samples/acme.git
  git_branch: master
  ports:
  - container: 5000
     http: 80
  dockerfile_path: "./Dockerfile"
  build_root: dashboard
  command: "/go/src/dashboard/dashboard --redis redis:6379"
 redis:
  image: redis
  ports:
  - 6379
```

### Using Habitus for builds

[Habitus is a build workflow tool for Docker-based applications](http://www.habitus.io/). It allows you to create a build workflow consisting of multiple steps for your Maestro application. Maestro fully supports Habitus. To enable Habitus on your Maestro application, you need to do the following:

1. Add a `build.yml` to your repository
2. Set `use_habitus` attribute to `true` in your `service.yml`
3. Set the `use_habitus_step` to the step you would like to use for your service in your `service.yml`

You can edit your `service.yml` directly from the Dashboard by clicking *Edit service* and then clicking the *Advanced* tab.

A Habitus build usually has multiple steps and each step can generate a Docker image. Using `use_habitus_step` attribute you can specify which step's results you would like to use as the image for the container.

Check out the [Habitus website](http://www.habitus.io/) for more information about generating a `build.yml`.

## Adding a DaemonSet

A DaemonSet ensures that a (single) copy of a specific Pod is added to every Node. This is useful for running background processes (aka daemons) but has many other uses. For more detail pleased read our [explanatory doc](/maestro/the-basics/concepts-and-terminology.html#daemonsets) on the subject.

To create a DaemonSet we simply set the `type` of any service to `daemon_set`. For example:

```yaml
service:
 web:
  image: training/webapp
  type: daemon_set
  ports:
  - container: 5000
     http: 80
```

This will use the image called "webapp" to spawn a single Pod called "web" on every Node in your Cluster.

## Database configurations

The first time you deploy an application, you can specify any required databases in the service configuration. These databases will be deployed and configured automatically, and their addresses and access credentials will be made available to the containers across the application with environment variables.

Once your application has been deployed, you can still add databases, but you need to do so using our database [Add-Ins](/maestro/how-to-guides/add-ins/) feature. 

As databases are fairly static components that rarely change without a migration, they aren't run in containers. This avoids the complexity and overhead of running databases in a container and allows Cloud 66 to perform replication and backups as normal. 

The allowed database values are: `postgresql`, `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `elasticsearch` , `rabbitmq` and `glusterfs`. For example:

```yaml
services:
 <service_name>:
  databases:
  - mysql
  - elasticsearch
```

## Environment variables

Any [environment variable](/maestro/how-to-guides/build-and-config/env-vars-advanced.html) defined in your application will be made available within your service container.

The syntax for calling environment variables in a service definition is:

```yaml
services:
 service_name:
  env_vars:
  VAR1: _env(VALUE_OF_VARIABLE)
```

You can also reference environment variable in other applications or services. For more info please read our [detailed guide](/maestro/how-to-guides/build-and-config/env-vars-advanced.html#syntax-examples) to the sharing env vars between apps and services.

## Setting a Service Account name

Kubernetes relies on its "[Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)" feature to manage the identity of processes running inside Pods.

By default all services belong to a service account named `default`. Normally this provides sufficient access for your application. However, should you require elevated access (e.g. to allow for log collection or metrics gathering), you can set a custom Service Account for any service using the `service_account_name`. For example:

```yaml
services:
 web:
  ports:
  - container: 3000
    http: 80
 service_account_name: public-front-end
```

This will make the service named "web" run under the "public-front-end" Service Account in Kubernetes.

Bear in mind that this service account will first need to be created on your cluster (with associated access bindings) before it will function correctly. Please read the [Kubernetes guide to configuring Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) for more detail.
